## Introduction

The Game Gallery is a repository that houses several classic games, each implemented as separate Python scripts. You can explore and play these games by running their respective scripts. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn and practice coding or just in the mood for some casual gaming, this repository has you covered.

## List of Games

1. **Battleship**: A two-player strategy board game where you try to sink the AI's battleship by guessing the coordinates on the board.

2. **Blackjack**: A card game where you play against an AI dealer and aim to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over.

3. **Caterpillar**: Control a caterpillar that eats leaves to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and yourself.

4. **Chess**: A classic two-player board game, available in both single-player and versus AI modes.

5. **Rock Paper Scissors**: A hand game where you compete against an AI opponent, choosing from rock, paper, or scissors.

6. **Tic Tac Toe**: A classic two-player game, also available in versus AI mode, where you aim to get three of your marks in a row.

## How to Play

To play each game, navigate to the respective game's folder in this repository and run the Python script associated with it. Follow the prompts and instructions provided in the game to make your moves and decisions.

Here's how to play each game:

- **Battleship**: Guess the coordinates (row and column) to sink the AI's battleship.

- **Blackjack**: Make bets and play your hand to beat the AI dealer.

- **Caterpillar**: Use arrow keys to control the caterpillar and collect leaves while avoiding collisions.

- **Chess**: Enter your moves in standard algebraic notation (e.g., 'e2e4') to play against a friend or the AI.

- **Rock Paper Scissors**: Choose your move (rock, paper, or scissors) and compete against the AI opponent.

- **Tic Tac Toe**: Make your moves by specifying the row and column to get three of your marks in a row.

## Repository Navigation

- Each game has its own file  within this repository.

- You can access the code for each game by navigating to the respective file and running the Python script.

- Feel free to explore and experiment with the code to understand how each game is implemented.
